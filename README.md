# USAGE
Make a file called `contents.py`. In contents.py, you have to declare:
- `smtp_name`: the name of your smtp server/address
- `smtp_port`: the smtp port
- `email`: your email/sending email
- `pw`: your email password
- `path`: the path to the notebook. this is only here because i have an alias that i can run from anywhere.
